<h1> THE FASTEST SPEED </h1>
<blockquote> <p><h4><b>“People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”</b></h4>

<cite>-ALBERT EINSTEIN</cite><hr>
<p style = "height: 40px; color: blueviolet;font-size: medium; font-weight: 700"> Using his special theory of relativty,einstein coined the term <b><u>"TIME DILATION"</u></b>. <br>it was fascinating as it stated objects moving at speed comaparable to <b><u>"SPEED OF LIGHT"</u></b> can show great wonders.<br> a simple explaination for why objects cant travel at a speed more than c [SPEED OF LIGHT] is as follows</p><br><hr>
SUPPOSE IF WE WERE TO ASSUME MEDIUMS IN WHICH OBJECTS MOVE FASTER THAN LIGHT. THEN WE ARE GOING TO GET MEDIUMS IN WHICH A BIRD DIES BEFORE THE BULLET LEAVES THE GUN.WE WILL HAVE MEDIUMS WHERE OUR MIND AND THINKING WILL CHANGE FASTER THAN LIGHT.<br><br><br>
 <u><b><i>DEATH OF THE BIRD</i></b></u> IN THE SCENARIO IS THE EFFECT WHICH IS BOUGHT UPON BY THE CAUSE THAT IS <u><b><i>FIRING OF BULLET</i></b></u> .SO IN SHORT ASSUMPTION OF OBJECTS MOVING COMPARABLE TO SPEED OF LIGHT WILL LEAD TO MEDIUMS IN WHICH THE EFFECT COMES BEFORE THE CAUSE.<br><br>
THIS SIMPLE EXAMPLE PUTS THE SPEED LIMIT TO A MAXIMUM OF C WHICH IS ROUGHLY 3<sub>E</sub><sup>8</sup>. <hr><br>

THIS WAS THE FORMULA DERIVED BY EINSTEIN IN HIS COURSE OF STUDY OF TIME DILATION . SEEING MATHEMATICALLY, HERE TIME IS USED AS REFRENCE BUT ACTUALLY THIS FORMULA CAN DEAL WITH ANY PHYSICAL QUANTITY . BE IT MASS , VELOCTY, DENSITY , LENGTH etc. V HERE IS THE SPEED OF OBJECT WHILE C IS SPEED OF LIGHT . T , SAY IT DENOTE ANY PHYSICAL QUANTITY IS DYNAMIC QUANTITY WHILE epsilon T IS THE REST QUANTITY . <br><br><br>
HE CONCLUDED THAT PHYSICAL QUANTITIES OF A BODY CHANGE WITH INCREASING SPEED . GENERALLY V IS NOT COMPARABLE TO C , SO THE TERM IN THE DENOMINATOR CAN GET REJCTED OUT . AND THE PHYSICAL QUANTITY COMES OUT TO BE EQUAL TO DYNAMIC QUANTITY. <br><br><hr>

HERE YOU CAN UPLOAD A SWEET PHOTO OF YOURS AND THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU TOOK IN IT . NOW THINK OF A PERSON READING THE SAME ARTICLE AS YOU BUT SITTING IN A NON INERTIAL TRAIN MOVING AT A SPEED OF C/2 . WILL THE TIME THAT PERSON WILL TOOK BE THE SAME . <br><br>
ABSOULETELY NOT , USING THE FORMULA MENTIONED ABOVE YOU WILL FIND THAT TIME HE TAKES TO UPLOAD THE SAME IMAGE WILL BE APPROX 1.17 TIMES THE TIME YOU TAKE , PROVIDED NETWORK CONDITIONS REMAIN THE SAME . <br><br>
GOING IN THE DEPTHS OF THIS DERIVATION IS HECTIC AT THE MOMENT INVOLVING USE OF CALCULUS AND DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. <br><br>

HOWEVER THIS IS JUST A MILD EXAMPLE .
